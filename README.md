# my-first-blog
My first blog using Django Framework.

Description
My blog is a system that I'm developing as a way to practice my knowledge regarding the Django framework. In this blog, I talk a little about django girls, a non-profit organization that has been inspiring and encouraging women to take courses in the technological area, and I also talk about programming. My main objective is to develop the blog so that any woman who has something to share about programming or anything about technology and that involves women, can share and thus reach out and encourage more women to embrace careers in the area of technologies.

Technologies/tools used
•	Python;
•	Django;
•	HTML;
•	CSS.
